Title of the Project 
Invoice Generator
Domain/Technology

Technologies used : Python, ReportLab, Built-in Modules
Problem Statement
The Invoice Generator is a Python-based tool that creates professional invoices in PDF format using client and product 
details. It allows businesses, freelancers, or shops to automate invoice creation — saving time and ensuring accuracy.
Proposed Solution
The Invoice Generator project is a Python-based application designed to create professional PDF invoices using 
the ReportLab library. It allows users to input essential details such as company name, customer information, 
invoice number, date, and a list of purchased items with quantity, price, and warranty details. The application 
processes this data, calculates totals, and formats it into a well-structured invoice layout. ReportLab is used to 
render the content into a downloadable PDF file. The solution is simple, efficient, and customizable, making it 
suitable for small businesses or freelancers. It can be further enhanced by adding features like discounts, taxes, 
or a GUI using Tkinter.
Objectives
 To automate invoice creation by generating a professional PDF based on user input.
 To reduce manual errors in billing calculations by automatically computing totals.
 To enable dynamic entry of multiple items, including details like quantity, price, and warranty.
 To generate well-formatted, printable invoices using the ReportLab PDF library.
 To create a reusable and customizable billing tool for businesses, freelancers, or individual use.
 To provide a lightweight and offline-capable solution without the need for external dependencies or 
internet access.

Expected Outcome
The project is expected to generate a professional, well-formatted PDF invoice based on user inputs using
